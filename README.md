# my_first_js_code
This is my first JS project. This project was written as a part of the home assignment of AndroidTLV Acadamy Node.JS course.

As part of the preparation for the upcoming course we would like to have an algorithm to calculate the top N students who attend the most lectures.

The function input is:
students - An array of the names of all students who registered for the course (no duplicate names).
attendees -  A 2D array - each row represents a different lecture, and itâ€™s content is an array of the attendees (i.e attendees[0] is an array of names who attend lecture #0).
N - The number of top students to return, and will always be equal to or less than the number of students who attend the lectures.

The function returns the top N students who attended the most lectures by descending order. 

Since this is my first JS code I guess things could be more efficient.
Even so, I tried to write a modular code, with an easy-to-understand design, as much as general as I thought.
I decided to use a HashMap since the keys (students names) are unique and for better complexity.

This was fun! Thanks.
